# Mask and Withoutmask Classification using YOLO
This README provides guidelines on how to train a YOLO model for detecting the presence or absence of masks on faces, using the dataset available on Kaggle. The instructions cover setup, training, and usage of the model.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be accessed on Kaggle:
[Mask and Without Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsanad26/mask-and-withoutmask)

## Setup

### Clone YOLO Repository
**Clone the appropriate YOLO repository** (YOLOv5 or YOLOv8) to your local machine or development environment.

### Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies specified in the repository's `requirements.txt`.

### Prepare the Dataset
Download and organize the dataset from Kaggle. Ensure the data is structured properly for YOLO training.

## Training

### Update `data.yaml`
Adjust the `data.yaml` file to correctly point to your train and validation data paths.

### Configure Model
If necessary, adapt the model configuration to match the number of classes and adjust any other hyperparameters or architectural details.

### Launch Training
Execute the training script provided by YOLO with parameters tailored to your dataset and training requirements.

## Model Usage

After training, use the trained weights to detect masks in new images or video streams.

## Improving Model Accuracy

### Addressing Dataset Bias

The dataset may exhibit bias, particularly if one class (e.g., 'with_mask') is over-represented compared to another (e.g., 'without_mask'). This imbalance can skew the model's performance and limit its effectiveness in practical applications.

**Recommendations:**

- **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, cropping, flipping, and color adjustment to enhance the diversity of the training set, particularly for underrepresented classes.

- **Balancing the Dataset**: Add more 'without_mask' images to achieve a more balanced dataset. This helps in training a more equitable and effective model.

- **Continuous Training**: Continuously train and fine-tune the model with newly augmented or sourced data to improve its accuracy and robustness.
